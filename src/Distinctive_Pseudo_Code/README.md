   ### Application of B√©zier curves in vehicle steering control.
   - We use a quadratic B√©zier curve to guide the vehicle toward the traffic signal block, accurately positioning the block along the curve. The quadratic B√©zier curve provides a smooth turning path; by setting a starting point, control point, and endpoint, it can adjust the vehicle‚Äôs driving trajectory, ensuring that the vehicle moves steadily toward the block. At the same time, the block‚Äôs position can be projected onto the B√©zier curve, facilitating precise positioning and avoidance maneuvers by the vehicle.
   - Here are the steps to draw a quadratic B√©zier curve and display it on an image:
    <ol>
    <li> Define control points: Each quadratic B√©zier curve requires three control points, which determine the curve's starting point, endpoint, and the shape of its bend.</li>
    <li>Calculate the points of the quadratic B√©zier curve: Use the B√©zier curve formula to generate points on the curve. For a quadratic B√©zier curve, the formula is as follows:</li>

      ![B√©zier curve](./img/B√©zier_curve.png) <br>
      P0,ùëÉ1,andùëÉ2 are the three control points, and ùë° ranges from [0, 1].
    <li>Draw the curve: Use OpenCV to render the red and green quadratic B√©zier curves.</li>
    </ol>
