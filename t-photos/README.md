- ### Team Photo  

  - Today is the first day that our team was established, so I took a photo to commemorate it. The location was chosen in the club classroom.

- ### Funny Photo
  - This is our attempt to take a photo using the method of stacking Arhats. In fact, the angle of our back is a bit wrong and we almost slipped down.
